Embed a video player in wordpress for livestreams on the JaNET infrastructure

== Description ==

The goal of this plugin is to provide an easy way for Student TV stations in the UK an easy way to embed a player for livestreams hosted on the NaSTA/JaNET infrastructure on their website.
Currently a proof of concept to add the clappr script to a page, and use shortcode to create a new Player object on the page with the HLS source for cross-platform compatibility.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin using the Wordpress Plugin install assistant 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!

== Usage ==
Simply place the short code `[nastaembed url='']` on any page or post where you want the player to appear Fill in the `url` with the `Code to play on iPhone/iPad's` as provided when creating a new webcast

This plugin was only developed as a proof of concept, and is far from complete or even fully working. I don't have the infratructure at home to fully test it.
